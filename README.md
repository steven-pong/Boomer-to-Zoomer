# From Boomer-to-Zoomer using a Double Diamond Design

By Steven Pong and Giancarlo Biasiucci 

## Introduction 

Age is but a cruel companion that becomes crueler with time. She might seem like a sweet tempting mistress, but she won’t sugarcoat man’s biological reality, senescence1. According to the CATO Institute’s Human Progress project, the expected lifespan of humans would reach 92 in 2100 from the present expected lifespan of 82. Throughout the ages, the average expected lifespan was 30 years. In around 120 years, the expected lifespan nearly tripled. It also mentioned that the average expectancy grows on average 3 months per year.2 If life expectancy increases as humans are becoming more and more sedentary and have a growing obesity problem, then by implication, mental health could be a significant contributor. 

## Research and Analysis

### Understand

#### Empathize

According to a 2018 World Health Organization (WHO) report on human lifespan, the average Canadian can expect an extra decade in their lifespan to  82.8 years compared to their counterparts of the 1960s. An inequitable but correctable problem space arises in elderly populations not present in non-elderly populations due to a technological divide between generations which results in an uneven distribution of potential lifespan gains.

#### Define

A person’s lifespan is determined by their senescence (health span) which is the biology of aging. Age is but a number that is not a reliable determinant of lifespan due to the wide spectrum of factors that determine a person’s lifespan. The lifespan of an elderly, as defined by the United Nations as being 60 years of age or older, are constrained from their genetic and environmental surroundings. While genetic predispositions are out of anyone’s control, environmental conditions aren’t. Those environmental conditions influence the physical and mental wellbeing of individuals. While physical wellbeing is a given, mental wellbeing is only recently becoming more and more accepted as being an integral element of holistic whole health. There is where the problem space arises. One of the “great” multipliers of health is access and adoption to modern technology which unfortunately for the elderly boomers is deficient to later generations.

### Explore

#### Ideate

Zoomers (individuals born after 1996) are “genetically” predisposed to be intuitively “technology-savvy” compared to Boomers (individuals born before 1965) who remain in the era of Fred Flintstone sending messages hammered and chiseled on stones in terms of technology savviness. While advances in medicine may artificially extend a Boomer’s lifespan, it cannot extend their mental health. At issue is the trade-off of an artificially extension of life  at the cost of remaining in a near vegetative state due to the lack of the astronomical mental stimulation Zoomers benefit from an era of information overload. 

#### Prototype

Zoomers, to an extent, may benefit from information overload from the perspective of stimulating the neurons which in turn stimulates mental health. While it unconceivable for a Boomer to immerse themselves into a Zoomer lifestyle, it can be posited that not all mental stimulation is created equally. A Zoomer mindlessly checking his social media feed every other second could be equated to a Boomer playing a challenging mind game for a few minutes. In essence, it’s not the quantity but the quality of neurons expended that could serve as the bridge to narrow that technological divide.
