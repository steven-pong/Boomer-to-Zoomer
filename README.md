### Introduction 

Age is but a cruel companion that becomes crueler with time. She might seem like a sweet tempting mistress, but she won’t sugarcoat man’s biological reality, *senescence* [^1]. According to the CATO Institute’s Human Progress project, the expected human lifespan in 2100 would reach 92 years of age from the present expected lifespan of 82 years of age [^2]. Throughout the ages, the average expected lifespan was 30 years of age. In around 120 years, the expected lifespan nearly tripled. It also identified an average life expectancy growth of an average of 3 months per year. If life expectancy increases as humans are becoming more and more sedentary and with a growing obesity crisis, then by implication, mental and physical health could be significant contributors to further elongate the average lifespan.

### Research and Analysis

#### Understand

> [!CAUTION]
> While elderly populations are capable of adapting to changing environments, unsurprisingly, due to man's inquisitive nature, they are not adapting to emerging and pervasive technologies at the same pace as non-elderly population. On a product adoption cycle's standardized bell shaped curved, the older the individual, the more likely they will deviate to the extremes of the curve. In the case of elderly individuals vis-a-vis emerging technology, they would be laggards.

##### Discover - discovering insight into the problem

According to a 2018 World Health Organization (WHO) report on human lifespan, the average Canadian can expect an extra decade in their lifespan to  82.8 years compared to their counterparts of the 1960s. An inequitable but correctable problem space arises in elderly populations not present in non-elderly populations due to a technological divide between generations which results in an uneven distribution of potential lifespan gains.

According to a 2018 CDC study on death associated with inadequate physical activity, there is a 7.8% increase in mortality in the 70 and older age group for members performing less than 150 minutes per week of moderate intensity aerobic exercise [^3]. In another 2019 CDC study on social isolation, there is strong evidence of an increased risk of 50% and over of dementia for those 50 years old and older. Likewise, there is a 29% increased risk of heart disease and a 32% increased risk of a stroke [^4]. There is strong evidence that links the life expectancy of elderly populations when their physical and mental wellbeing is neglected. 

In addition, elderly populations may not be able to make use of the same resources and tools for health improvement & management (when it comes to their physical health as well as their mental health) as younger individuals. Depending on the elderly individual in particular, the causes for this reduced usability of health tools & resources can vary (such as reduced mobility, reduced mental capacity, reduced cognitive functioning, reduced energy levels and mentally inhibiting diseases like dementia). It is extremely important to ensure that the elderly, no matter what their circumstances of living and health may be, have access to easily usable and assuredly beneficial resources for improving and managing their health, whether physical or mental.

There exist studies which conclude that cognitively stimulating games such as Sudoku contribute to improved cognitive health among elderly individuals (those aged 65 and older) [^GB-3]. One such study that has been documented by Ferreira et al. concluded that games such as Sudoku tended to result in improvements in elderly people’s abilities to greatly understand verbally expressed concepts, mentally take in as well as remember information, and remember past experiences along with associated details or feelings to a great extent [^GB-3]. Each of these improvements would be of objectively positive use to elderly individuals living at home or in retirement communities. Improved concept comprehension would make it easier for people such as family members, nurses or retirement home staff to effectively communicate with the elderly without many (if not any) misunderstandings or lack of understandability. Improvements to taking in and remembering information would facilitate the completion of everyday tasks and utilization of everyday items when it comes to the elderly since they would not have to spend as much (if not any) time searching for instructions/guidelines on task completion and item utilization. Improvements to greatly remembering past experiences would increase the likelihood of elderly individuals remembering people from their past who had been involved in such experiences, allow for them to periodically reflect on positive times of old while relaxing, and perhaps allow for them to complete tasks or use items involved in past experiences. 

The United States Department of Agriculture has published several health-related recommendations for individuals who are 60 years old or older [^GB-4]. They should consume foods from each of the 5 food groups (fruits, vegetables, grain foods, protein foods and dairy products [^GB-5], with the first two being recommended additions to snacks and complete meals [^GB-4]) on a daily basis in order to lower their chances of being afflicted with diseases like high blood pressure and heart disease [^GB-4]. They should avoid foods or drinks containing saturated fats, sodium and a high sugar content [^GB-4]. They should prioritize the intake of beneficial nutrients such as potassium, calcium and vitamins D & B12 [^GB-4]. They should drink water on a healthy and regular basis (with lactose-free, soy and juice beverages acting as additional verified means of hydration) [^GB-4]. They should consume a sufficient amount of protein every day in order to maintain a healthy amount of muscle mass and help one’s body to better absorb vitamin B12 [^GB-4]. When it comes to physical activity, they should aim for a minimum of 150 minutes of “moderate” (to a degree which causes one’s heart to undergo faster-than-usual beating) physical activity every week [^GB-4].  

##### Define - defining the area(s) to focus on

A person’s lifespan is determined by their senescence (health span) which is the biology of aging. Age is but a number that is not a reliable determinant of lifespan due to the wide spectrum of factors that determine a person’s lifespan. The lifespan of an elderly, as defined by the United Nations as being 60 years of age or older, is constrained from their genetic and environmental surroundings. While genetic predispositions are out of anyone’s control, environmental conditions aren’t. Those environmental conditions influence the physical and mental wellbeing of individuals. While physical wellbeing is a given, mental wellbeing is only recently becoming more and more accepted as being an integral element of holistic whole health. There is where the problem space arises. One of the “great” multipliers of health is access and adoption to modern technology which unfortunately for the elderly boomers is deficient to later generations.

A person's physical health is determined by the overall condition of their body in conjunction with numerous factors such as how physically active they are, what their diet is like and what they are exposed to (in terms of surroundings, sunlight, harmful substances, etc.) on a regular basis [^GB-1]. A person's mental health is determined by how well they handle stressful happenings and how emotionally well their manner of living is, both in conjunction with numerous factors such as the degree to which they are surrounded by objectively negative circumstances (such as violence and poverty), what their social & emotional circumstances are like, the degree to which they have the capacity to relieve themselves of stress, and how much harshly impactful negativity pertains to their past [^GB-2].

The following user personas demonstrate what identifiable cognition-related and health-related needs of the elderly will be addressed and hopefully met by our planned application.

#### Explore

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If a willingness exist to explore new environments, then it can be implied that an obstacle to adapting to an everchanging environment due to obstacles outside of the elderly population's control such as user friendly products or a radical paradigm shift in thinking. As an example, it could be argue when the automobile was gradually becoming more prelavent in society, your average buggy drawn whip jockey could never imagine a metal trinket replacing a traditional mode of transportation that has existed for generations. 

##### Develop - developing potential solutions

Zoomers (individuals born after 1996) are “genetically” predisposed to be intuitively “technology-savvy” compared to Boomers (individuals born before 1965) who remain in the era of Fred Flintstone sending messages hammered and chiseled on stones in terms of technology savviness. While advances in medicine may artificially extend a Boomer’s lifespan, it cannot extend their mental health. At issue is the trade-off of an artificially extension of life at the cost of remaining in a near vegetative state due to the lack of the astronomical mental stimulation Zoomers benefit from an era of information overload. 

One means of providing health improvement and management resources (for both one's physical and mental health) for elderly populations would be via the use of a specially tailored application featuring health-related tips (for both physical and mental health) and easily doable exercises. In addition, a means of cognitive stimulation should be included so as to make it possible for elderly populations to cognitively act in a manner akin to younger generations (essentially converting their manner of cognitively behaving from that of a complete "Boomer" to that of a "Zoomer"). However, it is important to guarantee that such an application will be easily able to be used by all elderly populations and actually provide great benefit to its target users. In the hopes of ensuring a fun cognitive stimulation experience, our approach to incorporating such in our application will be the inclusion of an easily playable Sudoku game, complete with simple yet sufficient instructions.

Below are some sketches of such an application:

Below are the wireframes of our planned application (the overall diagram which also acts as a "user flow diagram", or one which demonstrates how an intended user would ideally use the application via showcasing the intended flow (achieved using actions, in this case being button presses) through the app).

##### Deliver - delivering solutions (in the case of this project, prototypes) that work

Zoomers, to an extent, may benefit from information overload from the perspective of stimulating the neurons which in turn stimulates mental health. While it unconceivable for a Boomer to immerse themselves into a Zoomer lifestyle, it can be posited that not all mental stimulation is created equally. A Zoomer mindlessly checking his social media feed every other second could be equated to a Boomer playing a challenging mind game for a few minutes. In essence, it’s not the quantity but the quality of neurons expended that could serve as the bridge to narrow that technological divide.

The prototype of our application is shown below, over the span of the following four images:

![App Prototype Image Set 1](https://github.com/steven-pong/Boomer-to-Zoomer/blob/main/images/App%20Mockup%20I.jpg "App Prototype Image Set 1")
![App Prototype Image Set 2](https://github.com/steven-pong/Boomer-to-Zoomer/blob/main/images/App%20Mockup%20II.jpg "App Prototype Image Set 2")
![App Prototype Image Set 3](https://github.com/steven-pong/Boomer-to-Zoomer/blob/main/images/App%20Mockup%20III.jpg "App Prototype Image Set 3")
![App Prototype Image Set 4](https://github.com/steven-pong/Boomer-to-Zoomer/blob/main/images/App%20Mockup%20IV.jpg "App Prototype Image Set 4")

The font used throughout the mockups is known as Roboto, which has been listed as one of the most readable fonts according to Wix [^GB-6], one of the most well-known and well-reputed experts in website creation whose services are some of the best that are available online. With a moderate degree of boldness (not excessive yet not too thin), more readable g's and a's, and readability-enhancing line conjunction points which allow for every character to be efficiently distinguishable from one another [^GB-6], this font would be ideal for elderly individuals of all technological backgrounds and levels of vision or reading comprehension.

Additional guidelines for designing senior-friendly websites and applications exist online, with one particular and helpful set being incorporated into the visual design of the mockups. According to the guidelines used in conjunction with the designed mockups, the size of the text included in websites or applications made for seniors should be selected "generously" and correspond to at least 12-point fonts [^GB-7]. As such, all of the font sizes chosen for the mockups were considerably greater than what would correspond to a 12-point Roboto font. Excessively lengthy blocks of text are discouraged and should be split into more easily readable segments (shorter paragraphs, individual items on a clearly indicated list, etc.) [^GB-7]. None of the chunks of text featured in the mockups exceed 3 sentences or 8 lines, with larger groupings of text being used in the "About our App" page solely due to necessity. Whitespace (or "negative spacing") should be used between and around text segments as well as any images utilized within a developed website or application [^GB-7]. As such, plenty of readability-enhancing spacing was used in the mockups between text blocks, individual lists, buttons and even button text (with respect to the buttons within which they are contained). Lastly, the pairing of black text with light or white backgrounds will ensure the utmost readability of website or application content when it comes to seniors [^GB-7]. Black text on light-coloured backgrounds (primarily the light green colour serving as the main background colour of the application) is exclusively used throughout the mockups.

Existing Sudoku applications feature the 9 numbers involved in Sudoku arranged in a keypad-resembling format. Due to this arrangement being present in existing applications available for download and having the potential to be familiar to seniors who have used handheld phones with keypads at some point in their lives, it is an ideal arrangement for the numbers in our in-app Sudoku game. They also contain features such as a score tracker for the currently played game, a timer for the currently played game, and (for certain games) a mistake tracker that allows for up to 3 mistakes to be made. However, these features may serve as unwanted and unneeded distractions for our target users, who would simply want to make use of the in-app Sudoku game for cognitive stimulation and its corresponding benefits. Usage of too many colours across the entirety of the Sudoku game page (as opposed to solely when it comes to the different buttons within the page) may come across as disorienting to certain seniors, and as such were not included within the background of our Sudoku game page (as well as the entirety of our application).

Examples of existing Sudoku apps with keypad-formatted number buttons as well as additional features which would be unnecessary and likely unwanted when it comes to our application are shown below:

Two user journeys (detailed step-by-step ways in which the intended application users will ideally use it for the purposes which are aimed to be fulfilled using said application) are shown below:
